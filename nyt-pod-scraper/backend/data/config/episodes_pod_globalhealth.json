      "summary": "The episode provides an inside account of WHO pandemic treaty negotiations, now in their seventh round. Key sticking points include pathogen access and benefit sharing (PABS), with low- and middle-income countries demanding guaranteed access to vaccines and therapeutics in exchange for sharing pathogen sequences. WHO legal adviser Dr Maria Santos-Oliveira explains why the US and EU are resisting binding manufacturing transfer obligations, while African Union health representative Dr Kwame Asante argues that without enforceable equity provisions, the treaty will repeat the 'vaccine apartheid' of COVID-19. The programme examines the proposed pandemic fund financing mechanism and reveals that several G7 nations have privately indicated they will sign a watered-down treaty rather than accept the PABS framework sought by the Africa Group and SEARO member states.",

      "summary": "This episode assesses progress on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) one year after the UN High-Level Meeting pledged to reduce AMR deaths by 10% by 2030. Infectious disease epidemiologist Professor Chris Murray presents updated GRAM data showing drug-resistant infections now directly cause an estimated 1.4 million deaths annually, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia bearing the greatest burden. The episode examines why the antibiotic development pipeline remains critically thin -- only 13 new antibiotics are in Phase 3 trials, and most target gram-positive organisms, not the gram-negative pathogens causing the greatest mortality. Health economist Dr Priya Sharma explains how subscription-based 'Netflix models' for antibiotic procurement, pioneered by Sweden and the UK, could delink revenue from volume and incentivise development. The episode also covers the agricultural sector, where antibiotic use in livestock remains largely unregulated in many low-income countries.",
