      "summary": "The episode dissects the government's new NHS workforce strategy, which pledges a 40% increase in medical school places and a major expansion of physician associate roles. Health economist Professor Sarah Chen argues the plan underestimates the cost of training infrastructure, while BMA council chair Dr Adeola Mensah warns that without immediate measures to improve retention, new graduates will simply leave for better-paying systems abroad. The Health Secretary's adviser, James Lockhart, defends the timeline, pointing to parallel investment in digital health and AI diagnostics to reduce clinician workload. Notable tension emerges between those who see physician associates as a pragmatic solution and senior clinicians who argue the roles lack sufficient clinical oversight. The programme also covers the Royal College of Nursing's response, which describes the plan as 'a decade too late and a billion short'.",

Psychiatrist Dr Femi Adeyemi explains that while the reforms address longstanding racial disparities in sectioning rates, the proposed community treatment order changes may create new gaps in crisis care. Legal expert Professor Ruth Meredith notes the tension between patient autonomy and public safety, particularly in forensic settings. The episode highlights that despite three years of consultation, key questions about funding for community mental health services remain unanswered, which campaigners say will undermine the legislation's impact.",

      "summary": "The episode reviews the government's updated obesity strategy, which introduces advertising restrictions for HFSS foods before 9pm, mandatory calorie labelling in all food outlets, and a new GLP-1 receptor agonist prescribing programme for high-risk patients. Public health professor Dame Sally Holroyd argues that the strategy still lacks teeth on junk food pricing and industry reformulation targets. The programme explores the GLP-1 prescribing expansion, noting that while drugs like semaglutide show remarkable efficacy, the annual per-patient cost of around 2,500 GBP raises questions about NHS affordability at scale. A food industry representative argues that the advertising restrictions will disproportionately harm smaller producers while multinational brands simply shift to digital channels outside regulation.",
