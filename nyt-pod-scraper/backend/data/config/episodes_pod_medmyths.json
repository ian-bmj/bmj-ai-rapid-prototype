      "summary": "The episode investigates why ivermectin advocacy for COVID-19 persists despite definitive negative results from large randomised controlled trials (PRINCIPLE, TOGETHER, ACTIV-6). Misinformation researcher Dr Lydia Marchetti maps the network of substack authors, podcasters, and social media influencers who continue to promote the drug, often reframing the narrative as 'suppressed early treatment' rather than engaging with the evidence. Infectious disease specialist Professor Mark Hensley explains the methodological flaws in the small positive studies that circulate on social media, including confounding by concurrent corticosteroid use and publication bias. The episode draws parallels with historical medical misinformation patterns around laetrile and chelation therapy, suggesting that institutional distrust, not ignorance, drives uptake. Notable is a segment on how the 'ivermectin narrative' has evolved to incorporate broader anti-establishment health claims.",

      "summary": "This episode examines the viral claim that seed oils (canola, sunflower, soybean) are a root cause of chronic disease. Nutritional epidemiologist Dr Hannah Wei reviews the evidence, noting that large meta-analyses consistently show that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat from seed oils reduces cardiovascular risk. The episode traces the claim's origins to a selective reading of linoleic acid research and the 'ancestral health' movement. Food scientist Dr Raj Patel explains oxidation chemistry and why the 'seed oils are toxic at any dose' claim misrepresents dose-response relationships. However, the episode acknowledges legitimate concerns about ultra-processed food formulations where seed oils are one component in a broader matrix of additives, and notes that the NOVA framework offers a more nuanced lens than demonising a single ingredient.",

      "summary": "The episode explores the resurgence of raw (unpasteurised) milk consumption, driven by social media claims about superior nutritional value and gut health benefits. Microbiologist Professor Elena Vasquez presents evidence that pasteurisation causes minimal nutrient loss while eliminating pathogens including E. coli O157, Listeria, and Campylobacter -- organisms that have caused documented outbreaks linked to raw milk. The programme examines the regulatory patchwork: raw milk sales are legal from farms in England and Wales but banned in Scotland. A raw milk advocate farmer argues for consumer choice, while a paediatric infectious disease consultant describes treating a child with haemolytic uraemic syndrome from contaminated raw milk. The episode concludes that while the microbiome argument is scientifically intriguing, current evidence does not support raw milk as a meaningful probiotic delivery vehicle compared to proven fermented foods.",
