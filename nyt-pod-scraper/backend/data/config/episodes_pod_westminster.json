      "summary": "The episode provides line-by-line analysis of the Spring Budget's health allocations. The headline 3.2 billion GBP NHS uplift is examined by health economist Dr Laura Griffiths, who calculates that after adjusting for inflation, pay settlements, and demographic pressures, the real-terms increase is closer to 0.8 billion -- well below what the King's Fund estimates is needed to maintain current service levels. The programme reveals that social care received no new funding beyond existing commitments, prompting the Local Government Association to warn of 'a ticking time bomb for hospital discharge'. Political correspondent James Worth reports on behind-the-scenes Treasury tensions, with the Health Secretary reportedly losing a battle for an additional 1.5 billion for capital investment in crumbling hospital estates. The episode also covers the new 200 million 'health innovation fund' for AI and digital health, which opposition critics call 'a vanity announcement dressed up as reform'.",

      "summary": "This episode covers the parliamentary debate around the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which proposes a generational smoking ban and strict regulations on disposable vapes. Public health advocate Professor Sir Nicholas Wald presents modelling showing the ban could prevent 1.7 million smoking-related deaths over 50 years. Conservative backbencher Marcus Hale argues the legislation is 'nanny statism at its most extreme' and raises concerns about black market growth. The programme also examines the vaping provisions: while harm reduction experts support regulated vaping as a smoking cessation tool, paediatric pulmonologist Dr Jennifer Liu presents data on a 340% increase in under-16 vape-related A&E presentations over three years. The episode highlights the unusual cross-party dynamics, with rebel Conservative and Labour MPs forming an unlikely alliance against the bill's libertarian critics.",
