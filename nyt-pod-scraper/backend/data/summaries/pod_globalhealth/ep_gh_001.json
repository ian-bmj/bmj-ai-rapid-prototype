  "summary": "The episode provides an inside account of WHO pandemic treaty negotiations, now in their seventh round. Key sticking points include pathogen access and benefit sharing (PABS), with low- and middle-income countries demanding guaranteed access to vaccines and therapeutics in exchange for sharing pathogen sequences. WHO legal adviser Dr Maria Santos-Oliveira explains why the US and EU are resisting binding manufacturing transfer obligations, while African Union health representative Dr Kwame Asante argues that without enforceable equity provisions, the treaty will repeat the 'vaccine apartheid' of COVID-19. The programme examines the proposed pandemic fund financing mechanism and reveals that several G7 nations have privately indicated they will sign a watered-down treaty rather than accept the PABS framework sought by the Africa Group and SEARO member states.",
