  "summary": "This episode assesses progress on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) one year after the UN High-Level Meeting pledged to reduce AMR deaths by 10% by 2030. Infectious disease epidemiologist Professor Chris Murray presents updated GRAM data showing drug-resistant infections now directly cause an estimated 1.4 million deaths annually, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia bearing the greatest burden. The episode examines why the antibiotic development pipeline remains critically thin -- only 13 new antibiotics are in Phase 3 trials, and most target gram-positive organisms, not the gram-negative pathogens causing the greatest mortality. Health economist Dr Priya Sharma explains how subscription-based 'Netflix models' for antibiotic procurement, pioneered by Sweden and the UK, could delink revenue from volume and incentivise development. The episode also covers the agricultural sector, where antibiotic use in livestock remains largely unregulated in many low-income countries.",
  "gist": "AMR death toll continues to rise as the antibiotic pipeline stalls and agricultural overuse remains unregulated globally.",
