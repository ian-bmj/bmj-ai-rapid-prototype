  "summary": "The episode dissects the government's new NHS workforce strategy, which pledges a 40% increase in medical school places and a major expansion of physician associate roles. Health economist Professor Sarah Chen argues the plan underestimates the cost of training infrastructure, while BMA council chair Dr Adeola Mensah warns that without immediate measures to improve retention, new graduates will simply leave for better-paying systems abroad. The Health Secretary's adviser, James Lockhart, defends the timeline, pointing to parallel investment in digital health and AI diagnostics to reduce clinician workload. Notable tension emerges between those who see physician associates as a pragmatic solution and senior clinicians who argue the roles lack sufficient clinical oversight. The programme also covers the Royal College of Nursing's response, which describes the plan as 'a decade too late and a billion short'.",
