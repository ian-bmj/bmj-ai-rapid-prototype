  "summary": "This episode analyses the draft Mental Health Act reforms, focusing on the removal of learning disability and autism as grounds for detention, new patient choice provisions, and the introduction of statutory advance directives. Psychiatrist Dr Femi Adeyemi explains that while the reforms address longstanding racial disparities in sectioning rates, the proposed community treatment order changes may create new gaps in crisis care. Legal expert Professor Ruth Meredith notes the tension between patient autonomy and public safety, particularly in forensic settings. The episode highlights that despite three years of consultation, key questions about funding for community mental health services remain unanswered, which campaigners say will undermine the legislation's impact.",
