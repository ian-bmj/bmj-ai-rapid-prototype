  "summary": "The episode reviews the government's updated obesity strategy, which introduces advertising restrictions for HFSS foods before 9pm, mandatory calorie labelling in all food outlets, and a new GLP-1 receptor agonist prescribing programme for high-risk patients. Public health professor Dame Sally Holroyd argues that the strategy still lacks teeth on junk food pricing and industry reformulation targets. The programme explores the GLP-1 prescribing expansion, noting that while drugs like semaglutide show remarkable efficacy, the annual per-patient cost of around 2,500 GBP raises questions about NHS affordability at scale. A food industry representative argues that the advertising restrictions will disproportionately harm smaller producers while multinational brands simply shift to digital channels outside regulation.",
