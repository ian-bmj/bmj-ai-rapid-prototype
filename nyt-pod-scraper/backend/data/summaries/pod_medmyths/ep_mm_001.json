  "summary": "The episode investigates why ivermectin advocacy for COVID-19 persists despite definitive negative results from large randomised controlled trials (PRINCIPLE, TOGETHER, ACTIV-6). Misinformation researcher Dr Lydia Marchetti maps the network of substack authors, podcasters, and social media influencers who continue to promote the drug, often reframing the narrative as 'suppressed early treatment' rather than engaging with the evidence. Infectious disease specialist Professor Mark Hensley explains the methodological flaws in the small positive studies that circulate on social media, including confounding by concurrent corticosteroid use and publication bias. The episode draws parallels with historical medical misinformation patterns around laetrile and chelation therapy, suggesting that institutional distrust, not ignorance, drives uptake. Notable is a segment on how the 'ivermectin narrative' has evolved to incorporate broader anti-establishment health claims.",
