  "summary": "This episode examines the viral claim that seed oils (canola, sunflower, soybean) are a root cause of chronic disease. Nutritional epidemiologist Dr Hannah Wei reviews the evidence, noting that large meta-analyses consistently show that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat from seed oils reduces cardiovascular risk. The episode traces the claim's origins to a selective reading of linoleic acid research and the 'ancestral health' movement. Food scientist Dr Raj Patel explains oxidation chemistry and why the 'seed oils are toxic at any dose' claim misrepresents dose-response relationships. However, the episode acknowledges legitimate concerns about ultra-processed food formulations where seed oils are one component in a broader matrix of additives, and notes that the NOVA framework offers a more nuanced lens than demonising a single ingredient.",
  "gist": "Viral anti-seed-oil claims misrepresent evidence; the real concern is ultra-processed food systems, not individual ingredients.",

    "The dose makes the poison. Seed oils at normal dietary levels are not only safe, they are actively protective against heart disease. -- Dr Hannah Wei",
    "When someone tells you to avoid all seed oils, ask what they are selling. Usually it is butter or coconut oil at three times the price. -- Dr Raj Patel"
