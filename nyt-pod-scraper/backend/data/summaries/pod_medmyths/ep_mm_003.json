  "summary": "The episode explores the resurgence of raw (unpasteurised) milk consumption, driven by social media claims about superior nutritional value and gut health benefits. Microbiologist Professor Elena Vasquez presents evidence that pasteurisation causes minimal nutrient loss while eliminating pathogens including E. coli O157, Listeria, and Campylobacter -- organisms that have caused documented outbreaks linked to raw milk. The programme examines the regulatory patchwork: raw milk sales are legal from farms in England and Wales but banned in Scotland. A raw milk advocate farmer argues for consumer choice, while a paediatric infectious disease consultant describes treating a child with haemolytic uraemic syndrome from contaminated raw milk. The episode concludes that while the microbiome argument is scientifically intriguing, current evidence does not support raw milk as a meaningful probiotic delivery vehicle compared to proven fermented foods.",
  "gist": "Raw milk's claimed health benefits lack evidence while pasteurisation remains critical for preventing serious foodborne illness.",
