  "summary": "The episode provides line-by-line analysis of the Spring Budget's health allocations. The headline 3.2 billion GBP NHS uplift is examined by health economist Dr Laura Griffiths, who calculates that after adjusting for inflation, pay settlements, and demographic pressures, the real-terms increase is closer to 0.8 billion -- well below what the King's Fund estimates is needed to maintain current service levels. The programme reveals that social care received no new funding beyond existing commitments, prompting the Local Government Association to warn of 'a ticking time bomb for hospital discharge'. Political correspondent James Worth reports on behind-the-scenes Treasury tensions, with the Health Secretary reportedly losing a battle for an additional 1.5 billion for capital investment in crumbling hospital estates. The episode also covers the new 200 million 'health innovation fund' for AI and digital health, which opposition critics call 'a vanity announcement dressed up as reform'.",
  "gist": "Spring Budget's NHS uplift is far smaller than it appears once inflation and pay pressures are accounted for.",
