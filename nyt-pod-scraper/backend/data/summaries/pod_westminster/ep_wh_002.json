  "summary": "This episode covers the parliamentary debate around the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which proposes a generational smoking ban and strict regulations on disposable vapes. Public health advocate Professor Sir Nicholas Wald presents modelling showing the ban could prevent 1.7 million smoking-related deaths over 50 years. Conservative backbencher Marcus Hale argues the legislation is 'nanny statism at its most extreme' and raises concerns about black market growth. The programme also examines the vaping provisions: while harm reduction experts support regulated vaping as a smoking cessation tool, paediatric pulmonologist Dr Jennifer Liu presents data on a 340% increase in under-16 vape-related A&E presentations over three years. The episode highlights the unusual cross-party dynamics, with rebel Conservative and Labour MPs forming an unlikely alliance against the bill's libertarian critics.",
